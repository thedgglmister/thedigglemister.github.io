				Polarization on illegal immigration is a two-way street. The GOP gets most of the attention, and indeed a hardline immigration stance has become a defining issue for Republicans. But Democratic voters have become far more liberal on a slew of measurements regarding illegal immigration over the past decade. It was only 11 years ago that a majority of Senate Democrats voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for 700 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. It was just 10 years ago that Sen. Bernie Sanders voted against comprehensive immigration reform.

			<h2>A few fun facts about myself</h2>
			<p>
				I owned the same nokia brick cell phone from 2006 to 2016, until AT&ampT shut down their 2G network. I love Survivor. I love french press coffee, I have a cat named after MacGyver, my favorite number is 22, I'm not a huge fan of IPAs, I play video games like it's my life, I knew what I wanted to do at the age of 13, I do downhill mountain biking, my favorite food is bacon, and I broke my left arm twice.
